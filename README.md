# Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic AI in python that can play against a user with a simple ASCII interface.

The basic project allows the player to use the X markers, while the Alt version places the player in control of the O markers. The user is allowed to give the AI 'practice' matches against itself, allowing it to gain a better understanding of simple strategies and win conditions. Uses a list to serve as a brain; as games are won, successful moves are added to the list, encouraging the AI to make moves that are more likely to help it win.
